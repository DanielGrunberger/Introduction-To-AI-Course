We added a verification like that: If we have only human on the sequence, we give a small negative value for 2 pieces in sequence,
because it is a good thing for human but not so good since it is only two. If we have 3, we give a much smaller negative value, since
3 in  a row is very good (almost victory)
The same thing for the computer, but giving high positive values. If the computer has 2 or 3 pieces in a row, it is bad for human, so
we give a high positive value.
